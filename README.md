# EHTcontraction_analysis

### This is a quick and dirty way of analyzing the contraction of engineered heart tissue (EHT). The code is developed in matlab 2023b with image processing toolbox/computer vision tool box and signal processing toolbox.

### The key is to correctly set the binarization threshold (line 45 in extraccting_area.m) and imclose parameter (line 52 in extraccting_area.m).
